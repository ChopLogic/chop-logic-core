**Chop Logic Core** is a TypeScript library providing core functions for working with **symbolic logic formulas**. It is part of the broader [Chop Logic](https://github.com/users/SavouryGin/projects/1) project and offers essential utilities for propositional logic processing.

🚀 **Current Status:** The library is under active development, but several tested functions are already available for use in third-party projects.

## ✨ Features

## Features

- 🛠️ Factory methods for building logical symbols, operators, expressions, and well-formed formulas (WFF).
- 🔍 Tools for analyzing formulas:
  - Variable extraction
  - Sub-formula extraction
  - Truth table generation
  - Formula evaluation
  - Well-formedness checks
- ✍️ Inference rules from:
  - Hilbert-style Calculus
  - Natural Deduction Calculus (Introduction & Elimination rules)
- 🧪 Utilities for formula validation and consistency checks.
- 🔣 Tokenizer for parsing and handling logical strings.

## 📦 Installation

You can install `chop-logic-core` via npm:

```sh
npm install chop-logic-core
```

Or using yarn:

```sh
yarn add chop-logic-core
```

## 🔧 Usage

```ts
import { convertFormula, generatePropTruthTable } from 'chop-logic-core';

const formula = 'A ∧ B → C';
const converted = convertFormula(formula);
console.log(converted);

const truthTable = generatePropTruthTable(formula);
console.table(truthTable);
```

## ⚙️ Available Scripts

The following npm scripts are available for development and maintenance:

- **`npm run clean`** – Removes the generated `lib` folder.
- **`npm run build`** – Builds both ESM and CJS versions of the library.
- **`npm run lint`** – Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- **`npm run lint:fix`** – Runs ESLint with automatic fixes.
- **`npm run test`** – Runs Jest in watch mode.
- **`npm run test:ci`** – Runs Jest in CI mode, allowing zero tests to pass.
- **`npm run coverage`** – Generates a test coverage report.
